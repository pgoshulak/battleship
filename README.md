# About
A browser-based battleship implementation. This project was started as a side-project for LighthouseLabs.

Please note: original Lighthous Labs eslint settings have been overridden to allow ECMA 2015. This will allow more advanced concepts such as 'const'/'let', 'class', etc to be used. This change was accepted by the instructor prior to beginning, to allow these advanced concepts to be learned.
